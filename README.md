# COVID data exploration

## Some SQL exploration that I have done with Covid data from [ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) in order to maybe get some hidden insight.

Hi, i'm Myles aspiring Data Analyst and I have included some SQL exploration that i have done to dive a little deeper into Covid data from the entirety of the pandemic, there is quite a lot of data here which was really interesting and showed trends in the worlds reponse to the virus.

I have used Google BigQuery to perform the exploration, which I found to be the easiest option, for hosting and querying the data.
